## Design thinking process:
	* Ideate, Prototype and Testing

	*Dealing with bias in your data and machine learning models will become more and more
	important as you pass through the Ideate and Prototyping phases of the design thinking
	process. During the Ideate phase, your team members will be looking for new ideas, new ways of
	looking at the data. The Prototyping phase will involve the rapid creation and testing of
	machine learning models and pipelines. As you are being asked to construct these models, it is
	your responsibility as a data scientist to ensure that the models are as un-biased as
	possible. You will be the one who leads the discussion of bias during playbacks, and also the
	one who leads the way in making sure any models selected during the Prototype and Testing
	phases of the design thinking process are as un-biased as possible.
